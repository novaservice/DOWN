# DOWN

I trust this message finds you well. We regret to inform you that our project will be concluding its operations. We want to express our sincere gratitude for the support and engagement you have contributed throughout this journey.

Effective as of December 7th, we have entered a phase of increased operational constraints, leading to the unfortunate decision to shut down the project. Regrettably, our hosting budget has reached its limit, and the sustained demand has made it unsustainable to continue our services.

We deeply appreciate the time you've spent with us, and we want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. We understand the impact this may have, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Thank you for being a part of our community, and we hope that our paths may cross again in the future. If you have any immediate concerns or inquiries, please feel free to reach out to [Your Contact Information].

Once again, thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards, Dranca Denis-Gabriel (Founder and CEO Of novaproject securitysell & bluehost)
